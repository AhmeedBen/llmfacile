HiðŸ‘‹ I'M **Ahmed** a science computer engineer with 10 years of experience in the healthcare field.
with all my knowledge helping businesses integrate new technologies especially **LLM's** into their systems, I would be happy to share with you lessons on:

- How language models works from the ground up (**tokenization**, **embedding**, **pretraining** to **finetuning** and **inference**).

- How to adapt LLM's to specific use case through **prompt engineering** or **finetuning**.

- Explore different finetuning and quantization techniques such as **PEFT** **LoRA** and **QLoRA**.

- Share insights on how to deploy models to cloud **(GCP,AWS,AZURE)** or locally **(GGML,GGFU,GPTQ)**.

- Share different projects **(chatbots** and **systems)** using **RAG** (Retrieval Augmented Generation), **external API**, **Function Calls**, through tools such as **LangChain**, **HuggingFace**, **transformers** etc.
- LLMOps with **Mlflow**, cost efficient deployment using **vLLM** and **Skypilot**.


> ### **Let's Connect:**
> I'm excited to engage with fellow tech enthusiasts, and anyone captivated by the potential of LLMs  and generative AI.
